# DAV_Head_Assignments
I had contested for the position of Head of the [Data Analytics and Visualisation (DAV) Team, IIT Bombay](https://in.linkedin.com/company/dav-team-iit-bombay) in Summer 2022. As part of the procedure for selection, I had done few assignments. One of them was performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the [Barcelona 2017 Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xvivancos/barcelona-data-sets). You can view my presentation for the same in file DAV_EDA_Report.pdf, the code notebook is DAV_EDA.ipynb, the dataset is accidents_2017.csv. There was another one on application of ML on [Credit Card Default Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). You can view my code notebook as DAV_ML.ipynb and the dataset is also available here.
